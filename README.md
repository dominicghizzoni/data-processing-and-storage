Standard c++ compilation, in terminal run:
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main
./main

Which will run my sample input, or you can copy the code without the main function and run with any test cases.

I think to make this an official assignment there should be starter code with a specific language to be used. Instructions were clear other than what our code should output if any output. I think it should be clear whether we make a main function with an output or just implementations for the functions.
